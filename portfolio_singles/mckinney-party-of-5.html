                <p>My wife and I decided during a car ride to start a blog site together.  I had previously built her a site using Wordpress.  This time, however, I wanted a site that was cheaper, and did not have the overhead of a database running the system.  I had been hearing about JAMstack, and after some research, decided this was the way to go.</p>
                <p>The site is built using Jekyll, hosted on GitHub, and we use CloudFlare to serve out the site.  There is a general Blog page that lists all published articles, in addition to category pages.</p>
                <p>In the future, I hope to use pagination features, as well as integrate a search widget into the website.</p>
