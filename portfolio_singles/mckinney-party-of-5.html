                <p>My wife and I decided during a car ride to start a blog together.  I had previously built her a site using Wordpress.  This time, however, I wanted something that was cheaper, and did not have the overhead of a database.  I had been hearing about JAMstack, and after some research, decided that was the way to go.</p>
                <p>The blog website was built using Jekyll, hosted on GitHub, and used CloudFlare to serve out the site.  There is a general Blog page that lists all published articles, in addition to category pages.</p>
                <p>With the many responsbilities and activities that come with a fulfilling life, we decided to close our blog.  However, the site has been archived on this website.  The final post was written in early 2021.</p>
