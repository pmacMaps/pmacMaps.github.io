        <h1>Patrick N. McKinney - Cartographer & Developer</h1>
        <p>I am a cartographer and developer interested in telling the stories of communities through maps and technology.  I have helped local governments, state governments, and non-profits tell their stories through maps for print, interactive web maps, and websites.</p>
        <p>I am working on re-designing my website.</p>
